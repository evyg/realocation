# The Ultimate Cost of Living Calculator: Find Where Your Salary Goes Further

*Last updated: January 2026*

## Your Salary Is Lying to You

You make $120,000 a year. Sounds great, right? 

But here's what nobody tells you: that $120K in San Francisco might only give you $2,500/month in actual spending money after taxes, rent, and basic expenses. The same salary in Austin? You could have $5,000/month.

That's not a small difference. That's **$30,000 per year** that could go to:
- A down payment on a house
- Maxing out your 401K
- Actually enjoying your life

## Why Traditional Cost of Living Calculators Fail

Most calculators just show you that "Austin is 35% cheaper than San Francisco." Cool. But what does that actually mean for YOUR situation?

They don't account for:
- **Your specific tax bracket** (federal AND state)
- **Your housing needs** (studio vs. 3BR family)
- **The compound effect** over 5, 10, 20 years

## What Actually Matters: Net Monthly Surplus

Forget percentages. The only number that matters is: **How much money do you have left at the end of each month?**

Here's the real math for a $150K salary:

| City | Take-Home After Taxes | Average Rent (2BR) | Monthly Surplus |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| San Francisco | $8,750 | $4,200 | $2,550 |
| New York City | $8,100 | $4,500 | $1,600 |
| Austin | $9,800 | $2,100 | $5,700 |
| Miami | $9,800 | $2,800 | $5,000 |
| Denver | $9,200 | $2,400 | $4,800 |

**The difference between SF and Austin is $3,150/month. That's $37,800/year.**

## The States With No Income Tax

If you can work remotely, these states instantly give you a raise:
- Texas
- Florida  
- Nevada
- Washington
- Tennessee
- Wyoming
- South Dakota
- Alaska
- New Hampshire (no income tax on wages)

Moving from California (13.3% top rate) to Texas (0%) on a $200K salary saves you **$20,000+ per year** in state taxes alone.

## But What About Career Growth?

"But I need to be in SF for tech jobs!"

Do you though? Remote work changed everything. And even if you take a 10% pay cut for a remote role, you might still come out ahead:

**Scenario:**
- $180K in San Francisco → $3,200/month surplus
- $160K remote in Austin → $5,800/month surplus

The "lower" salary gives you **$2,600 MORE per month**.

## The 10-Year Calculation

This is where it gets wild.

$3,000/month difference × 12 months × 10 years = **$360,000**

Invested at 7% average return? That's closer to **$500,000**.

Half a million dollars. Just from choosing where to live.
