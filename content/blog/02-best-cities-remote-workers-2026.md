# Best Cities for Remote Workers in 2026: Where Your Salary Goes Furthest

*A data-driven guide to maximizing your income through strategic relocation*

## The Remote Work Arbitrage Opportunity

Remote work created the biggest wealth-building opportunity in a generation. Here's why:

**Your employer pays you based on:** Where the company is located (usually a high-cost city)

**Your expenses are based on:** Where you actually live

The gap between these two? That's free money.

## How We Ranked These Cities

We calculated the **monthly surplus** (money left after taxes, housing, and basic expenses) for a $120,000 remote salary in 50 major US cities.

Factors included:
- Federal income tax (2024 brackets)
- State income tax
- Local/city income tax
- FICA (Social Security + Medicare)
- Median rent for a 2-bedroom apartment
- Cost of living index adjustments

## Cities to Avoid for Remote Workers

These cities eat your salary alive:

| City | Monthly Surplus | vs. Houston |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| New York City | $1,400 | -$4,000/mo |
| San Francisco | $2,100 | -$3,300/mo |
| Los Angeles | $2,400 | -$3,000/mo |
| Boston | $2,600 | -$2,800/mo |
| Seattle | $2,800 | -$2,600/mo |

Living in NYC instead of Houston costs you **$48,000 per year**.

## The Relocation Math

Let's say you currently make $120K in San Francisco and have $2,100/month surplus.

**Option A: Stay in SF**
- Year 1 savings: $25,200
- Year 5 savings: $126,000
- Year 10 savings: $252,000

**Option B: Move to Austin**
- Year 1 savings: $61,200
- Year 5 savings: $306,000
- Year 10 savings: $612,000

**Difference over 10 years: $360,000**

And that's before investment returns.

## What About Pay Cuts?

Some companies reduce pay for employees who relocate. Here's when it still makes sense:

**Scenario: $120K in SF → $100K remote in Austin**

SF ($120K): $2,100/month surplus
Austin ($100K): $4,200/month surplus

**You "lost" $20K in salary but gained $25,200/year in actual money.**

The pay cut is an illusion.

3. **Visit first** - Spend a week or two working from potential cities
4. **Consider hybrid** - Some cities are worth flying in monthly for in-person time
5. **Think long-term** - Where do you want to be in 5-10 years?

## The Bottom Line

Remote work lets you decouple your income from your location. 

The smartest remote workers are using this to build wealth faster than ever—earning Bay Area salaries while paying Midwest costs.

The question isn't whether you *can* do this. It's whether you're willing to.
