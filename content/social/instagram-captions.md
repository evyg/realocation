Swipe to see how much you ACTUALLY keep in different cities →

## Carousel 2: "Tax-Free States"
**Caption:**
These 8 states won't take a cut of your paycheck 👀

If you work remote, this is literally free money.

California → Texas on a $150K salary = $12,000/year saved in state taxes ALONE.

Add lower rent? You're looking at $30-40K more per year.

Same job. Same work. Way more money.

## Carousel 3: "SF vs Austin Breakdown"
**Caption:**
I broke down a $150K salary in SF vs Austin.

The difference will make you sick 😅

San Francisco: $2,500/month left
Austin: $5,700/month left

That's $38K/year. 

In 10 years = $380K
Invested = $500K+

Half a million dollars.

For choosing where to live.

## Carousel 4: "The Real Cost of NYC"
**Caption:**
NYC isn't just expensive.

It's $400K over 10 years expensive.

Broke it down slide by slide 👆

And no, the "energy" and "opportunities" don't make up for it if you work remote.

Math doesn't lie.
