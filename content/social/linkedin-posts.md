## Post 1: The Data-Driven Approach

**[Headline]**
I analyzed salary data across 50 US cities. The results changed how I think about compensation.

**[Body]**
Most professionals focus on maximizing salary.

But here's what the data shows:

A $150K salary in San Francisco = ~$2,500/month after taxes and rent.
A $150K salary in Austin = ~$5,700/month after taxes and rent.

That's a $38,400/year difference. Same salary.

After 10 years:
- San Francisco path: $252,000 saved
- Austin path: $612,000 saved

The gap? $360,000.

The variable that matters isn't your salary. It's your surplus—what's left after you pay to live.

This is why I built Realocation: a free calculator that shows where your specific salary goes furthest.

If you work remote (or can negotiate it), this might be the most valuable 30 seconds you spend today.

## Post 2: For Remote Workers

**[Headline]**
Remote work created the biggest wealth-building opportunity in a generation.

**[Body]**
Here's why:

Your employer pays you based on "market rate" — usually tied to their HQ location (NYC, SF, etc.).

Your expenses are based on where you actually live.

The gap between these two numbers? That's free money.

Example:
- SF-based salary: $150K
- Living in Austin: State tax savings + lower rent = $38K/year extra

Even with a 15% "location adjustment" pay cut:
- $127K in Austin STILL beats $150K in SF by $20K/year

The math doesn't lie.

The smartest remote workers I know are quietly using this arbitrage to build wealth 2-3x faster than their peers who stayed in high-cost cities.

Are you optimizing for salary? Or for surplus?

## Post 3: Addressing the Objections

**[Headline]**
"But I need to be in [expensive city] for my career."

Do you though?

**[Body]**
I hear this all the time. Let's examine it:

**Objection 1: "The opportunities are there."**
→ Remote work changed this. Most tech/finance roles can now be done anywhere.

**Objection 2: "Networking is better in person."**
→ True. But is it worth $30-40K/year? You could fly in monthly and still come out ahead.

**Objection 3: "My company requires it."**
→ Have you asked? Many companies are more flexible than their official policy.

**Objection 4: "I like the city."**
→ Valid! But make it a conscious choice, not a default. Know what it costs you.

I'm not saying everyone should move. I'm saying everyone should know the math.

$150K in SF: $2,500/month surplus
$150K in Austin: $5,700/month surplus

That's $3,200/month. $38K/year. $380K per decade.

Is your city worth that?

Only you can answer. But at least now you have the data.

## Post 4: For Founders/Entrepreneurs

**[Headline]**
If you're bootstrapping a company, your location might be your biggest expense.

**[Body]**
Here's the math most founders ignore:

**SF/NYC founder burn rate:**
- Salary to yourself: $100K
- After taxes + rent: ~$1,800/month surplus
- Runway extension from location: 0

**Austin/Miami founder burn rate:**
- Same salary: $100K
- After taxes + rent: ~$4,200/month surplus
- Extra cash per year: $28,800

That's nearly $30K more per year to put toward:
- Product development
- Marketing
- Extended runway
- Your mental health

When every dollar matters, geography is strategy.

I built Realocation to help people (founders included) see where their money goes furthest.

## Post 5: The Company Perspective

**[Headline]**
Unpopular opinion: Companies that adjust pay by location are playing themselves.

**[Body]**
Here's why:

Scenario A (Current practice):
- Pay SF employee $150K
- Pay Austin employee $120K (20% "cost of living adjustment")
- Austin employee feels underpaid, leaves for competitor paying market rate

Scenario B (Pay for value):
- Pay both $150K
- SF employee: stressed, high burn rate, always looking
- Austin employee: thriving, loyal, high retention
- Net cost to company: Same. Better outcomes.

The "location adjustment" is a legacy practice from when work was tied to place.

In a remote-first world, pay for the role, not the zip code.

The best companies have figured this out. Has yours?
