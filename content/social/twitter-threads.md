## Thread 1: The Wake-Up Call

🧵 I ran the numbers on my $150K salary across 50 US cities.

The results genuinely shocked me. Here's what I found:

1/ In San Francisco, after federal taxes, state taxes, and rent... I have about $2,500/month left.

That's for EVERYTHING else. Food, car, savings, fun.

On $150K.

2/ Same salary in Austin, Texas?

$5,700/month left over.

No state income tax + lower rent = $3,200 MORE per month.

3/ That's $38,400 per year.

In 10 years, that's $384,000.

Invested? Could be half a million.

HALF. A. MILLION.

4/ "But Austin doesn't have the same opportunities!"

Maybe. But let's say you take a 15% pay cut to work remote from Austin.

$127K in Austin still beats $150K in SF by $1,800/month.

5/ Here are the top 5 cities where $150K goes furthest:

1. Houston, TX → $6,100/mo surplus
2. Austin, TX → $5,700/mo
3. San Antonio, TX → $5,900/mo
4. Jacksonville, FL → $5,400/mo
5. Nashville, TN → $5,200/mo

6/ And the worst:

1. NYC → $1,600/mo surplus
2. San Francisco → $2,500/mo
3. Los Angeles → $2,800/mo
4. Boston → $3,100/mo
5. Seattle → $3,400/mo

7/ Your salary is just a vanity metric.

The only number that matters: what's left after taxes and housing.

## Thread 2: The Tax Breakdown

🧵 The difference between a $150K salary in California vs Texas:

Let me break down exactly where your money goes 👇

1/ CALIFORNIA ($150K salary)

Federal tax: $28,000
State tax: $12,000
FICA: $11,500

Take home: $98,500/year
Monthly: $8,208

2/ TEXAS ($150K salary)

Federal tax: $28,000
State tax: $0
FICA: $11,500

Take home: $110,500/year

That's $1,000/month just from taxes.

3/ Now add housing.

CA (SF) 2BR median: $4,200/mo
TX (Austin) 2BR median: $2,100/mo

Difference: $2,100/month

4/ Total difference:

Tax savings: $1,000/mo
Housing savings: $2,100/mo

TOTAL: $3,100/month more in Austin

That's $37,200/year.

5/ "But California has better weather!"

Does $37K/year buy you enough sunshine? 

You could literally fly to Hawaii once a month and still come out ahead.

6/ The states with NO income tax:

• Texas
• Florida
• Nevada
• Washington
• Tennessee
• Wyoming
• South Dakota
• Alaska

Remote workers: this is free money.

## Thread 3: Remote Work Math

🧵 The math that convinced my friend to leave NYC for Miami:

She made $180K. She was "doing well."

Here's what she discovered 👇

1/ NYC breakdown ($180K):

After federal, state, AND city tax: $10,200/mo
Rent (1BR Manhattan): $4,500/mo
Left over: $5,700/mo

2/ Miami breakdown (same $180K):

After federal tax only: $12,100/mo
Rent (1BR Brickell): $3,200/mo
Left over: $8,900/mo

3/ Difference: $3,200/month

Per year: $38,400

She was essentially paying $38K/year for... what exactly?

4/ "But my job is in NYC!"

Her company went hybrid. She negotiated full remote.

Even with a 10% pay cut ($162K), she STILL comes out $2,000/month ahead.

5/ She moved 6 months ago.

Already has $15K more in savings than she would have.

Same lifestyle. Better apartment. Beach on weekends.

6/ The future of work is location-arbitrage.

Your employer pays based on "market rate."
Your expenses are based on where you ACTUALLY live.

Optimize the gap.

## Standalone Tweets

**Tweet 1:**
$100K in San Francisco = $100K in lifestyle
$100K in Austin = $140K in lifestyle

Same work. Same hours. 40% more life.

The city you choose is a financial decision.

**Tweet 2:**
Unpopular opinion: Taking a 20% pay cut to move somewhere cheaper is often a raise.

$120K in SF → $2,500/mo surplus
$96K in Austin → $4,200/mo surplus

Math > ego.

**Tweet 3:**
States with no income tax:
- Texas
- Florida
- Nevada
- Washington
- Tennessee
- Wyoming
- South Dakota
- Alaska

If you work remote, you're leaving money on the table.

**Tweet 4:**
The real cost of living in San Francisco:

Not just high rent.
Not just expensive food.

It's the $400K you won't have in 10 years because you stayed.

**Tweet 5:**
Your company: "We pay market rate!"
You: *moves to cheaper market*
Your company: "No wait, not like that"

Location arbitrage is the cheat code.
